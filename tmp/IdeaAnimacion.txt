Yes, it is possible to achieve that behavior in React using state management and by implementing transition animations. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to create a state variable that will keep track of whether the card is visible or hidden:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
   const [showCard, setShowCard] = useState(false);
   //...
}
```

Next, you will add an onClick event handler to the card component that will toggle the value of `showCard` and use the value of `showCard` to conditionally render the card component with or without the transition animation classes and also to change the URL:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
   const [showCard, setShowCard] = useState(false);
   const history = useHistory();

   // handleClick will toggle `showCard` and change the URL
   const handleClick = () => {
      setShowCard(prevState => !prevState);
      history.push("/card"); // change the URL to /card
   }

   return (
      <>
         <div onClick={handleClick}>Click to show/hide the card</div>
         <div className={`card ${showCard ? 'card-visible' : 'card-hidden'}`}>
            <div className="card-content">
               <!-- Card content here -->
            </div>
         </div>
      </>
   )
}
```

Finally, you will add the CSS classes that will provide the card with transition animations:

```css
.card {
   position: absolute;
   right: -300px;
   width: 300px;
   height: 200px;
   transition: right 0.5s;
}

.card-visible {
   right: 0;
}

.card-hidden {
   right: -300px;
}
```

With this implementation, the Card component will be hidden to the right of the screen by default. When you click on the element, the `showCard` state will change, and the card will slide to the left. At the same time, the URL in the address bar will change to "/card".
